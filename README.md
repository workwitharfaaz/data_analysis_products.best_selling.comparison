# data_analysis_products.best_selling.comparison

In this project i used python to clean data and then i appended the data via jupyter notebook into sql database and analysed the data.


Following are some problems that were solved -

1. Find top 10 highest revenue generating products

2. Find top 5 highest selling product in each region

3. Find month over month growth comparison for 2022 and 2023 revenue. Example - Jan 2022 vs Jan 2023
