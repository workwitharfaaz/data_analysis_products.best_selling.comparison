# data_analysis_products.best_selling.comparison

In this project, I utilized Python for data cleaning and transformation, and integrated the cleaned data into a SQL database using Jupyter Notebook. Once the data pipeline was established, I performed in-depth analysis to extract actionable insights.

Key problems solved:

Identified the top 10 highest revenue-generating products.

Determined the top 5 best-selling products in each region.

Conducted a month-over-month revenue growth analysis, comparing performance in 2022 vs 2023 (e.g., January 2022 vs January 2023).
